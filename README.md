# THERMOSOLVR
A parallelised and fully functional C++17 program, THERMOSOLVR was developed over the course of my PhD studies in 2022. This program was implemented according to the Quantum Cluster Equilibrium (QCE) theory which aims to predict/understand the thermodynamic properties of neat liquids.<sup>1</sup> Originally developed in 1998 by Weinhold, a core foundation of QCE theory is the existence of the thermodynamic critical point as this is the point at which the liquid and vapor phase can co-exist.<sup>1</sup>

It is therefore possible to extend standard statistical thermodynamic equations originally devised for gases to also elucidate liquid phase properties due to the thermodynamic critical point.<sup>1</sup> Based on this fundamental principle, Weinhold further theorised that differences between a low density gas and its more structured liquid counterpart can be accounted for by considering molecular clusters (see below) as an intermediate species between the two states.<sup>1</sup>

# THERMOSOLVR
A parallelised and fully functional C++17 program, THERMOSOLVR was developed over the course of my PhD studies in 2022. This program was implemented according to the Quantum Cluster Equilibrium (QCE) theory which aims to predict/understand the thermodynamic properties of neat liquids. Originally developed in 1998 by Weinhold, a core foundation of QCE theory is the existence of the thermodynamic critical point as this is the point at which the liquid and vapor phase can co-exist.

It is therefore possible to extend standard statistical thermo- dynamic equations originally devised for gases to also eluci- date liquid phase properties due to the thermodynamic critical point.61 Based on this fundamental principle, Weinhold further theorised that differences between a low density gas and its more structured liquid counterpart can be accounted for by con- sidering molecular clusters as an intermediate species between the two states.

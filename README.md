# THERMOSOLVR
A parallelised and fully functional C++17 program, THERMOSOLVR was developed over the course of my PhD studies in 2022. This program was implemented according to the Quantum Cluster Equilibrium (QCE) theory which aims to predict/understand the thermodynamic properties of neat liquids. Originally developed in 1998 by Weinhold, a core foundation of QCE theory is the existence of the thermodynamic critical point as this is the point at which the liquid and vapor phase can co-exist.

It is therefore possible to extend standard statistical thermodynamic equations originally devised for gases to also elucidate liquid phase properties due to the thermodynamic critical point. Based on this fundamental principle, Weinhold further theorised that differences between a low density gas and its more structured liquid counterpart can be accounted for by considering molecular clusters (see below) as an intermediate species between the two states.
